            Auntie Elizabeth sharing the Word of God from Luke 2 where God choose to announce the arrival of His son, the light of the world to lowly shepherds watching over the very sheep being prepared for the sacrifices at the Tempke in Jerusalem, the very shepherds who guarded the sheep from wolves and predators with their own lives, the shepherds who knew lambs to be raised unblemished were wrapped in swaddling clothes so no harm could damage or blemish the lambs.  These men understood the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes was obviously the prophecies messiah the Lamb of God who would be tested and tried for any sin or imperfection by the priests and Governor Pilate before being slaughtered for the sins n sicknesses of all mankind.  It is no wonder the excited ran to see this marvelous child , the Son of God, the Lamb of God
