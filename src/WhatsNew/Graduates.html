    <h2>Annah Begins Articles</h2>
    <h5>August 25 2023</h5>
    <p>
        Annah beginning her articles on September 1 at the Attorney General Office in Mbabane (our capital city). Annah completed her LLB law degree this year. Annah is one of our very first children to ever sleep in New Hope Centre Timber House (the wooden ark saving a generation from a flood of despair disease and death). We celebrated on Friday September 1, 2023 our twentieth anniversary since Annah, Deborah and Joel who slept their first night in a brand new, brightly painted sparkling clean Main House that could accommodate 30 children. On the very day, Friday September 1, 2023 she went to work for her first day in the capital city, Mbabane at the Attorney General, beginning her qualifying articles.  To God be the glory, and to her sponsors over the years who gave great bundles and bundles of love; especially Heather Stevens who searched for others to join in sponsorship until Annah has finally set her feet on the path of her destiny professionally.
