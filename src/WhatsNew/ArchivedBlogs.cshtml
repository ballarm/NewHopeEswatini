    <h2>CELEBRATING PALM SUNDAY</h2>
    <h5>20-April-2019</h5>

    <p>Gathering at Hope Academy in preparation for Praise March around perimeter of New Hope Centre to establish the holiness, the glory, the peace and the hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>
        We gathered praise rings, praise banners, guitars, recorders, and  happy smiles.  We commemorated Mary anointing Jesus with expensive perfume before his passion by taking oil in our hands and anointing the land, the houses, the schools - to set our land  apart for holiness and commanding every evil and dark being or presence to depart. We are a city of light on the hill that cannot be hidden, a family of leaders of ESwatini that will not be held back.
