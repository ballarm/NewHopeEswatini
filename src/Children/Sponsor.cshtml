<table><tbody><tr><td><p>Sponsoring a child for $/£30, 50, 100 or 120 will provide some of their following needs: </p><ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0cm" type="disc"><li>Medical health care </li><li>Clothing </li><li>Running of the home - water, caregivers, electricity, gas for cooking, security etc. </li><li>Education - school fees, uniform, books, tuition fees, sports activities </li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How can I communicate with the child I sponsor?</span></p><p>You are encouraged to pray for the child and to develop a relationship through correspondence. You may write to the child you are sponsoring as often as you like. When you write, the child will benefit from knowing that someone in addition to their New Hope Centre family really cares for them. Your words of encouragement will make a difference to the child in many ways and the more you write, the more they will reap the benefits of your relationship. As you write and share your joys, over comings, loves, and all your life’s experiences this will build joy, hope and love in the child’s life. We, also encourage you to send the child photos of yourself or family, which they will treasure and keep in their “memory boxes”. </p><p>Please note that all correspondence is first read by a team member. We ask that you do not make any mention of being orphaned in your correspondence as this triggers loss once again. </p></td><td><img src="./Sponsor a Child _ New Hope Centre, Swaziland_files/ethan.jpg" alt="" border="0"></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will the child write to me?</span></p><p>Every year you will receive from the sponsored child:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0cm" type="disc"><li>Thank you card; </li><li>Christmas card; </li><li>Updated photo of the child on a bookmark calendar; and </li><li>Annual newsletter from New Hope Centre </li></ul><p>The child will write to you twice a year with the help of their teachers.Letter writing is developmental for the child as it improves their basic literacy, self-awareness and ability to put thoughts and feelings into words. As you exchange correspondence with the child your relationship will grow and develop. The child will also develop a sense of confidence and self-worth with the love you express through letters and prayers.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I send gifts to the sponsored child?</span></p><p>We encourage you to give additional monetary gifts to the child for special occasions, to address specific needs or simply as an act of love. These gifts are another effective way for you to reinforce your care, commitment and support to the child. 100% of the child gift amounts go to your sponsored child. To make certain that these funds are used appropriately, team members will accompany the child shopping so they learn about budgeting, making wise choices and preparing a shopping list of needs and wants. </p><p>You may also send a gift to your sponsored child’s community ministry. With your monetary gift of $/£20 to $/£300, the child and team from New Hope Centre will buy items for orphan headed families or widows in our community, such as blankets, livestock, and food supplies. We will work closely with the family to determine the greatest need and then purchase items accordingly. All family gift amounts go to the needy family and your gift empower your sponsored child to learn compassionate giving also. </p><p>You may choose to send a gift to your sponsored child by mail.Please mark on the item “GIFT AID FOR ORPHANS” and on the custom form please mark “NO RESALE VALUE”. Also please do not put any value on the package as it is a gift.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Is there anything I cannot send to the child I sponsor?</span></p><p>As a sponsor, you have many opportunities to correspond with the child and we encourage you to do so. We ask that when you communicate with the sponsored child to provide comments and materials consistent with Christian values and philosophies. Please do not send comments or materials that: </p>

Also so that another sponsor can be found for your sponsored child. </p><p>Your relationship with your sponsored child makes you a very important person who has a significant role in their life, particularly as it gives the child value as a person knowing there is someone who believes in them enough to support them. You stand alongside pastors, teachers, family and friends who are taking an active role in encouraging and developing the child to become a confident Biblical sound leader of tomorrow. </p><p>Thank you for wishing to sponsor a precious child of God’s at New Hope Centre.</p>
